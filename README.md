# Practice-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-R-Python

Often times we learn something but there is no metric to test our understanding of the topic. The right way to see if the concept has really been understood is to use it in real world. No matter what your preferance for Data Science is, the dataset presented here can be used across any language. Instructions follow:

There are 3 files:

**1. create_insert_scripts**: This file contains the scripts with which you can create tables and insert data into them.

**2. data_analysis_questions**: This files contains the scripts that you need to find solutions of.

**3. tables**: If you dont want to create tables, you can just look at the table and formuate your query/ code.

These questions were primarily designed to answer using sql but you can use r or python. These exercise questions are just for practice and you must move on to difficult levels once you finish them. 

**Note**: The questions ask you to solve them using data wrangling techniques. Visualizations are not expected. Solutions are not presented, you have to evaluate them on your own.
